# Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes global average sea level data from 1880 and predicts sea level rise through 2050 using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

## Features
- **Scatter Plot**: Global sea level data from 1880.
- **Line of Best Fit**: Predicts sea level rise through 2050 based on all data.
- **Recent Fit Line**: Predicts sea level rise through 2050 using data from 2000 onward.

## Files
- `sea_level_predictor.py`: Python script containing plotting and prediction functions.
- `epa-sea-level.csv`: CSV data file with global average sea level changes.
- Plot is saved as `sea_level_plot.png`.
